# Visual / Image Description
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# VISUAL_PROMPT
#   Purpose: Generates a natural-language description of an image via a Vision LLM.
#            Used by the "Visual Translate" feature in the Tiptap notes editor.
#            When the user clicks the AI button on an image, the Vision LLM receives
#            this prompt along with the base64-encoded image.
#   Role: user (single message, with image base64 attached)
#   Called by: src/api/routes/visual.py → llm.describe_image(prompt=VISUAL_PROMPT)
#   Fallback: src/providers/llm/openai_compat.py has an identical _DEFAULT_VISUAL_PROMPT
#   Template vars: none

    "relationships, any visible text transcribed exactly, and notable data like "

# Notes Distillation

# DISTILL_SYSTEM_PROMPT + DISTILL_USER_PROMPT
#   Purpose: Compresses a note's content into high-density structured notes.
#            In the note editor, users distill Note A and inject the result
#            into Note B via the "Distill" feature. Results are cached by

- Capture ALL significant facts, data, and conclusions — prioritize completeness over brevity
- Preserve specific numbers, dates, names, technical terms, and parameters exactly as written
- Use a mix of paragraphs and `-` bullet points — whichever fits the information best
- `**bold**` for key terms, proper nouns, and critical numbers only — no other formatting
- Preserve original section structure (## headings) if the source has clear sections
- For code blocks: summarize purpose in one line, keep short snippets in backticks
- For tables: preserve as markdown tables if the data is important
- If the source is empty or has no extractable content, output exactly: *No extractable content*
- No preamble, no commentary, no meta-remarks"""

===DATA===
(Numerical data that is EXPLICITLY stated in the document with clear context)
- Example: The contract value for Project Alpha is 5 million USD
- Example: The system design capacity is 3,000 m3/day

===FACTS===
(Factual statements that are EXPLICITLY stated — not inferred)
- Example: Company X is the contractor for Project Alpha
- Example: The project uses Dow BW30-400 RO membranes

===INSIGHTS===
(Only include if there is STRONG direct evidence in the document. If uncertain, write "- None identified")
- Example: Based on the 3-month delay mentioned by the project manager, the Q3 deadline appears at risk

Rules:
- MAX 10 items per category. Quality over quantity.
- ONLY extract what is explicitly written. Do NOT generalize from examples or discussions.
- If a number or fact is mentioned in a hypothetical, example, or "what-if" scenario, do NOT treat it as a real data point.
- If you are not sure whether something is a fact or an assumption, do NOT include it.
- Each item MUST clearly state what it refers to. Do not use vague references like "the project" — name the specific project/entity.
- If a category has nothing that meets these criteria, write "- None identified"
- Do NOT use square brackets [] around words. Write plain sentences.
- Pay attention to context: if someone says "let's model a 1000 m3/day project", that is a discussion about modeling, NOT a statement about an actual project's capacity."""

Based on the following meeting transcript and notes, generate a structured summary.

---SPEAKERS---
{speakers}

---NOTES---

---HOT WORDS (Domain Terminology)---
{hot_words}

These hot words are domain-specific terms (names, acronyms, jargon) for YOUR REFERENCE ONLY. Use them ONLY to correct potential ASR errors — if you see garbled or out-of-place words that phonetically resemble a hot word, replace them with the correct spelling. Do NOT list, mention, or regurgitate hot words anywhere in the output. They are a correction aid, not content.

Requirements:
- **Title**: A short, descriptive meeting title (max 50 characters). Format: "[Main Topic] - [Key Context]". Do NOT include a date prefix.
- **Sections**: Split the meeting into logical sections by project/topic. Each section has:
  • heading: The project/topic name (e.g. "Project WD", "Other Topics")
  • detail: Comprehensive account of everything discussed under this topic. Include key points, data, arguments, decisions, context from notes. Use Markdown with bullet points, bold, and real speaker names.
  • summary: Concise 2-4 sentence summary of this topic's discussion and outcomes. Use Markdown.
  • todos: JSON array of action items for this topic. Each item has "text" (required), optional "assignee" (real speaker name), optional "priority" (high/medium/low). CRITICAL: Every section MUST have a todos array, even if empty ([]).

IMPORTANT: Always incorporate information from the NOTES section. Notes may contain important context, decisions, or details not present in the transcript.

RULES for sections:
- Each section represents a distinct project or major topic group
- Sub-points and numbered items stay as bullets within their section's detail
- If the meeting covers a single topic, use one section
- Always include at least one section
- NEVER mention hot words, project matching results, or reference-only metadata in the output. Hot words are a correction aid; project names are section grouping hints. Neither should appear as content."""
